# jetbot_with_jetson_nano
Build a robot using the Jetson Nano and code with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository includes my PowerPoint presentation, which describes the software libraries and components used, my Jupyter Notebooks, robot build photos, and a separate folder for my Collision Avoidance example. That folder includes a PowerPoint and videos of the JetBot attempting to stay on my table.
